"Target - disease evidence from all data sources. Every piece of evidence supporting an association between a target (gene or protein) and a disease or phenotype is reported and scored according to the confidence we have in the association. Multiple target-disease evidence from the same source can be reported in this dataset. The dataset is partitioned by data source, therefore evidence for individual sources can be retrieved separately. The dataset schema is a superset of all the schemas for all sources."
