# Query Name: DiseaseSimilarEntitiesQuery
# Entity Type: disease
# Description:
# Retrieves similar entities (diseases) based on literature co-occurrence
#  using a Word2Vec model trained with PubMed. Returns related entities with
#  similarity scores.
# Variables:
# id: String!, ids: [String!] (default: []), threshold: Float (default: 0.5),
#  size: Int! (default: 15), entityNames: [String!] (default: []), cursor:
#  String
# Pagination Behavior: Full results
# Notes:
# Query successfully tested with EFO_0000685 (rheumatoid arthritis), returned
#  5 similar entities with similarity scores.
