# Query Name: OntologySummaryFragment
# Entity Type: disease
# Description:
# Summary fragment for disease ontology information including therapeutic area
#  classification
# Variables: efoId: String!
# Pagination Behavior: Full results
# Notes:
# Originally a fragment, converted to standalone query. Query successfully
#  tested with EFO_0000685 (rheumatoid arthritis). Returns basic disease
#  ontology data including id, name, isTherapeuticArea flag (false), and
#  therapeutic areas array with 2 IDs (EFO_0000540, OTAR_0000006). Used by
#  Summary component to display either 'Therapeutic area' or 'Belongs to N
#  therapeutic areas' text. No pagination - returns complete data. Related to
#  OntologyQuery.gql which includes full ontology hierarchy (parents,
#  children, ancestors).
