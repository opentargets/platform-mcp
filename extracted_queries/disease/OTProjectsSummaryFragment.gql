# Query Name: OTProjectsSummaryFragment
# Entity Type: disease
# Description:
# Fragment that fetches OTAR project codes for a disease to display count in
#  summary. Returns just project codes used to calculate project count in
#  Summary component.
# Variables: efoId: String!
# Pagination Behavior: Full results
# Notes:
# Originally a fragment, converted to standalone query. Query structurally
#  valid and executes successfully. Tested with EFO_0000685 (rheumatoid
#  arthritis) and MONDO_0004975, both returned empty arrays (expected - OTAR
#  projects are private/restricted data). Returns array of otarProjects with
#  otarCode field. Used by Summary component to display project count. No
#  pagination - returns complete list. Related to full query
#  OTProjectsQuery.gql which includes additional fields (status, projectName,
#  reference, integratesInPPP).
