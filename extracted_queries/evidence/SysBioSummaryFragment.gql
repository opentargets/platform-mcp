# Query Name: SysBioSummaryFragment
# Entity Type: evidence
# Description:
# Retrieves the count of Systems Biology evidence entries for a target-disease
#  association. Used by Summary component to display evidence count without
#  loading full evidence details. Returns gene signature evidence from systems
#  biology studies.
# Variables:
# ensemblId: String! (Example: ENSG00000157764), efoId: String! (Example:
#  EFO_0000756)
# Pagination Behavior: Full results
# Notes:
# Originally a fragment, converted to standalone query. Query successfully
#  tested with BRAF (ENSG00000157764) + melanoma (EFO_0000756), returned
#  count=0 indicating sparse data coverage. Uses size=0 parameter to retrieve
#  only count without fetching evidence rows for efficient summary display.
#  Returns total number of Systems Biology evidence entries without
#  pagination. Uses enableIndirect=true to include indirect evidence
#  associations. datasourceIds=['sysbio'] targets Systems Biology gene
#  signature data. Used by Summary component in SysBio section to display
#  entry count. Related to full SysBioQuery (sectionQuery.gql) which fetches
#  detailed evidence including studyOverview, literature references, and
#  pathway/gene set names with pagination support (size parameter defaults to
#  3500). SysBio provides literature-curated gene signatures causally
#  associating targets with diseases. Specialized evidence type with limited
#  but high-quality coverage.
