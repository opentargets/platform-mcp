# Query Name: OrphanetSummaryFragment
# Entity Type: evidence
# Description:
# Retrieves the count of Orphanet evidence entries for a target-disease
#  association. Used to display summary statistics showing the number of rare
#  disease genetic association evidence from the Orphanet datasource.
# Variables:
# ensgId: String! (Example: ENSG00000198947), efoId: String! (Example:
#  EFO_0000508)
# Pagination Behavior: Full results
# Notes:
# Originally a fragment, converted to standalone query. Query successfully
#  tested with BRAF (ENSG00000157764) + melanoma (EFO_0000756), returned
#  count=0. Also tested with DMD (ENSG00000198947) + cardiomyopathy
#  (EFO_0000508), returned count=5 with Orphanet evidence for Duchenne
#  muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, familial isolated dilated
#  cardiomyopathy, X-linked non-syndromic intellectual disability, and
#  symptomatic form of muscular dystrophy in female carriers. Uses size=0
#  parameter to retrieve only count without fetching evidence rows for
#  efficient summary display. Returns total number of Orphanet evidence
#  entries without pagination. Orphanet specializes in rare disease
#  gene-phenotype associations with confidence levels (Assessed) and
#  literature PMIDs. Common cancer associations typically return count=0 as
#  Orphanet focuses on rare diseases. Uses enableIndirect=true to include
#  related disease evidence. Used by Summary component in Orphanet section to
#  display entry count format 'X entr(y|ies)'. Related to full
#  OrphanetQuery.gql which fetches detailed evidence including disease
#  mappings, variantEffect, directionOnTrait, alleleOrigins,
#  variantFunctionalConsequence, and confidence levels with pagination support
#  (size parameter).
