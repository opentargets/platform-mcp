# Query Name: AdverseEventsSummaryFragment
# Entity Type: drug
# Description:
# Retrieves the count of adverse events associated with a drug from
#  pharmacovigilance data
# Variables: chemblId: String!
# Pagination Behavior: Full results - no pagination in fragment
# Notes:
# Fragment converted to standalone query. Successfully tested with vemurafenib
#  (CHEMBL1201585), returned count=19. The summary fragment only returns the
#  total count; pagination is handled by the separate AdverseEventsQuery which
#  uses page parameters.
