# Query Name: MechanismsOfActionSummaryFragment
# Entity Type: drug
# Description:
# Fetches mechanisms of action summary for a drug, including unique action
#  types, unique target types, and parent/child molecule relationships
# Variables: chemblId: String! (Example: CHEMBL1201585 for vemurafenib)
# Pagination Behavior: Full results - no pagination
# Notes:
# Originally a fragment, converted to standalone query. Successfully tested
#  with CHEMBL1201585 (vemurafenib), returned uniqueActionTypes=['INHIBITOR'],
#  uniqueTargetTypes=['single protein'], parentMolecule=null,
#  childMolecules=[]. Used by Summary component to display mechanism of action
#  overview. Provides high-level summary of drug mechanisms without detailed
#  target information.
