# Query Name: VariantEffectQuery
# Entity Type: variant
# Description:
# Retrieves in silico variant effect predictions from multiple computational
#  methods (CADD, PolyPhen, SIFT, etc.) including assessment scores,
#  normalized scores, and prediction flags for a specific genetic variant.
# Variables: variantId: String! (Example: 19_44908822_C_T)
# Pagination Behavior: Full results
# Notes:
# Query successfully tested with variants 19_44908822_C_T (rs7412, APOE
#  variant) and 1_113761186_C_A. No pagination - returns all variant effect
#  predictions in a single response array. Response includes variant object
#  with id (variant identifier in chr_pos_ref_alt format), referenceAllele,
#  alternateAllele, and variantEffect array where each entry contains: method
#  (prediction tool name like VEP, SIFT, GERP, AlphaMissense, FoldX),
#  assessment (categorical prediction like missense_variant, deleterious,
#  ambiguous, or null for numeric-only tools), score (raw prediction score
#  from the tool, range varies by method), assessmentFlag (optional
#  warning/flag about prediction quality or context, or null), normalisedScore
#  (score normalized to 0-1 scale for cross-method comparison). For rs7412:
#  returned 5 predictions from VEP (score=0.66, assessment=missense_variant),
#  SIFT (score=0, assessment=deleterious, normalisedScore=1 indicating high
#  deleteriousness), GERP (score=4.61, normalisedScore=0.913 indicating high
#  conservation), AlphaMissense (score=0.422, assessment=ambiguous,
#  normalisedScore=0.005), and FoldX (score=0.91, normalisedScore=0.455
#  indicating moderate structural impact). For 1_113761186_C_A: returned 2
#  predictions from VEP (score=0, assessment=upstream_gene_variant,
#  normalisedScore=0 indicating no coding impact) and GERP (score=-5.43,
#  normalisedScore=0 indicating low conservation). No fragments to inline.
#  Used in VariantEffect section Body.tsx component which displays both table
#  and chart views. Table view uses OtTable with sortable columns: Method
#  (with tooltip showing method description and documentation link from
#  VARIANT_EFFECT_METHODS constant), Prediction (assessment value with tooltip
#  if assessmentFlag present), Score (raw score to 3 sig figs), and Normalised
#  score (normalized score to 3 decimals). Chart view uses VariantEffectPlot
#  component showing normalized scores across methods. Data is filtered to
#  remove null methods and sorted alphabetically by method prettyName. The
#  component sets defaultView=VIEW.chart to display visualization first.
#  Section visibility determined by hasData function checking
#  variantEffect.length > 0. Prediction methods include: VEP (Variant Effect
#  Predictor, reports consequence types), SIFT (sorting intolerant from
#  tolerant, predicts protein function impact), GERP (genomic evolutionary
#  rate profiling, conservation score), AlphaMissense (DeepMind deep learning
#  pathogenicity predictor), and FoldX (protein stability and folding impact
#  prediction). Related constants in @ot/constants define
#  VARIANT_EFFECT_METHODS with prettyName, description, and docsUrl for each
#  method. The normalisedScore field enables fair comparison across methods
#  despite different raw score ranges (e.g., SIFT 0-1, GERP -12 to +6, VEP 0-1
#  for missense tolerance). Section id is in_silico_predictors with name
#  Variant effect and shortName VP.
