# Query Name: VariantEffectSummary
# Entity Type: variant
# Description:
# Retrieves variant effect prediction methods for a given variant. Used in the
#  summary view to quickly check which in silico predictors have data
#  available.
# Variables: variantId: String! (Example: 19_44908822_C_T)
# Pagination Behavior: Full results
# Notes:
# Originally a fragment (VariantEffectSummaryFragment on Variant), converted
#  to standalone query. Query successfully tested with variants
#  19_44908822_C_T (rs7412, returned 5 methods: VEP, SIFT, GERP,
#  AlphaMissense, FoldX) and 1_113761186_C_A (returned 2 methods: VEP, GERP).
#  No pagination - returns all available variant effect prediction methods in
#  a single response. Response includes variant object with id (variant
#  identifier in chr_pos_ref_alt format) and variantEffect array where each
#  entry contains method (prediction method name string like VEP, SIFT,
#  PolyPhen, CADD, REVEL, GERP, AlphaMissense, FoldX, EVE, ESM1b). Used in
#  Summary.tsx component via usePlatformApi to determine section visibility
#  via hasData function which checks if variantEffect array length > 0. This
#  minimal query efficiently checks data availability without fetching
#  detailed prediction scores and assessments. The main Body component uses
#  VariantEffectQuery.gql which provides full details including method,
#  assessment (prediction outcome), score, assessmentFlag (warning flags), and
#  normalisedScore for displaying in the variant effect table and chart
#  visualization. Fragment inlined with query wrapper and id field added for
#  proper query structure. No nested fragments. Related to
#  VariantEffectQuery.gql which provides complete prediction details with
#  scores and assessments for the detailed table view showing VEP, SIFT,
#  PolyPhen, CADD, REVEL, GERP, AlphaMissense, FoldX, EVE, ESM1b and other in
#  silico prediction tools.
