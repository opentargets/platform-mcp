# Query Name: VariantEffectPredictorSummary
# Entity Type: variant
# Description:
# Retrieves canonical transcript information for a variant to determine if
#  transcript consequences should be displayed in the summary.
# Variables: variantId: String! (Example: 19_44908822_C_T)
# Pagination Behavior: Full results
# Notes:
# Originally a fragment (VariantEffectPredictorSummaryFragment on Variant),
#  converted to standalone query. Query successfully tested with variants
#  19_44908822_C_T (rs7412, returned 61 transcript consequences) and
#  1_113761186_C_A (returned 21 transcript consequences). No pagination -
#  returns all transcript consequences in single response as array. Response
#  includes variant object with transcriptConsequences array where each
#  element contains isEnsemblCanonical (boolean indicating whether this is an
#  Ensembl canonical transcript). Used in Summary.tsx component via
#  usePlatformApi to determine section visibility via hasData function which
#  checks if transcriptConsequences?.length > 0. This minimal query
#  efficiently checks data availability for the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)
#  section without fetching full transcript consequence details. The section
#  displays predicted effects of variants on gene transcripts including amino
#  acid changes, consequence types (missense, synonymous, etc.), impact
#  ratings, and distances from regulatory features. Fragment inlined with
#  query wrapper and variantId variable added. No nested fragments. Related to
#  VariantEffectPredictorQuery.gql which provides full transcript consequence
#  details including gene symbols, variant consequences, amino acid changes,
#  UniProt accessions, codons, distances from footprints/TSS, impact scores,
#  consequence scores, transcript indices, LOFTEE predictions, SIFT
#  predictions, and PolyPhen predictions for the detailed table display.
