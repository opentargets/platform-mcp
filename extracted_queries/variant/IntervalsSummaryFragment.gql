# Query Name: IntervalsSummaryFragment
# Entity Type: variant
# Description:
# Retrieves the total count of genomic intervals (regulatory regions)
#  associated with a variant from the Ensembl-to-Gene (E2G) model. Used to
#  determine if the Intervals section has data to display.
# Variables: variantId: String! (Example: 19_44908822_C_T)
# Pagination Behavior: Full results
# Notes:
# Originally a fragment (IntervalsSummaryFragment on Variant), converted to
#  standalone query. Query successfully tested with variants 19_44908822_C_T
#  (returned count=58) and 1_113761186_C_A (returned count=1). No pagination -
#  returns only the count field, not the actual interval data. Response
#  includes variant object with intervals object containing count (integer
#  representing total number of genomic intervals/regulatory regions
#  associated with the variant). Used in Summary.tsx component to determine
#  section visibility via hasData function which checks if count > 0. This is
#  a minimal query used only for summary/availability check - fetches only the
#  count field. The full interval data with detailed fields is fetched by
#  IntervalsQuery.gql which uses pagination (size=3000, index=0) to retrieve
#  actual interval rows with chromosome, start, end, target (gene), biosample
#  (tissue/cell), score (E2G confidence 0-1), distanceToTss (distance to
#  transcription start site), studyId (ENCODE experiment), intervalType, and
#  resourceScore. Fragment inlined by wrapping in query declaration and adding
#  variantId variable. Related to IntervalsQuery.gql which provides paginated
#  full interval details for the detailed table showing genomic regions that
#  may regulate genes, based on Ensembl-to-Gene predictions integrating
#  epigenomic and 3D chromatin data from ENCODE and other sources.
